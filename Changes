v0.09_04

- Before writing a new post instead of showing a list of all the modules now 
the user first will search for a module name.  post link should give a search
box that will let the user search within the names of the modules. The result
should be a restricted list with only a few module names in a pull-down menu
like we have now.  The search is a regular SQL LIKE search and we add % signs
at both ends of the typed in word.
