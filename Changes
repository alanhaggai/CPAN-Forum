  Add /author/PAUSEID to show all posts related to modules maintained by
  PAUSEID

  Move some of the run modues to be in the CPAN::Forum::RM namespace.

  Add large button on dist page to start a new post.

  Added process_missing_dist that will automatically add distributions
  if they are accessed by one of the search engines and exist on
  search.cpan.org
  When a request arrives to /dist/XYZ and XYZ is not in our database
  we can fetch http://search.cpan.org/dist/XYZ and add the entry to our 
  database. In order not to let some random person bombard our server and that
  in turn that we don't bombard search.cpan.org (though our server will 
  crash much sooner than search.cpan.org) we can add a list of trusted client
  ip addresses from the list in the log file. After all very soon most of the
  correct entries will be added to the database. A trusted ip would be
  GoogleBot 66.249.66.3, msnbot 65.55.213.74, inktomisearch and similar
 
  Cleaned up STDERR, moved voluntary warnings to logger

  Cookie exparation was increased from 1 day to 14 days

  Provide a csv file with the number of posts for each distribution so 
  other sites can include it.

  Logging: add client IP to logger to enable filtering log messages based on that 

  Clean up STDERR, move (some) voluntary warnings to logger

- More tests

- Start using Parse::RecDescent

v0.09_04

- Before writing a new post instead of showing a list of all the modules now 
the user first will search for a module name.  post link should give a search
box that will let the user search within the names of the modules. The result
should be a restricted list with only a few module names in a pull-down menu
like we have now.  The search is a regular SQL LIKE search and we add % signs
at both ends of the typed in word.
