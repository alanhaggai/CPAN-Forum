- replace the e-mail address checking by  if ($q->param('email') !~ $Email::Address::addr_spec) {

- Enable people to edit their posts 
   - Shall we track changes ? 
   - Shall we display the orinal date and the last update date ?
   - Shall we display the post on its new date (order the display result by date ?)

- Somehow let a module author (or anyone ?) subscribe/unsubscribe to all of her modules.
  Rephrasing: 
    1) Enable listing modules based on module author
	2) Enable subscribing to several modules at the same time

  Fetch data from  cpanratings and display
  Provide statistics on number of comments per distro to be displayed on search.cpan

- Admin: hide a message (or a whole thread) (database already has field)

- Admin: freeze a distro: (cannot add new message but still can see the earlier messages)

- Admin: (or even the author ?) should be able to move a message from one module to 
          another module or group.
 
- Replace the /post/number link by /post/TITLE_OF_POST ???

- make the page size (for paging) user configurable


- Allow users to subscribe for announcement service:
  A script that will send an announcement on the new version of every module to
  those who asked for this information.

- JavaScript that lets users to set all the modules in /mypan to the same value
  (either All message or thread starter or Followup or nothing)

- Let people select a group of distros (e.g. all the distros by author SZABGAB)
  and show them on the /mypan interface (or just subscribe to all of them)
