- Record the date when a user joined
- Record when a user last visited


- Enable people to subscribe to all messages or all thread starters or all followups
  (probably group = 0 will do it)
  
- Add announcement service (check for new versions of modules and send e-mail
  to those whom are interested in announcements.
  For example I just tried to install a module but it failed its test. Checking 
  search.cpan.org I noticed the module has been updated lately and looking at
  the results of the CPAN Testers I can see I am not the only one with these problems.
  So for now I skip the installation of this module but I'd like to get an e-mail
  when a new version of this module is uploaded to CPAN so I can try it while
  it is hot. I can subscribe to the announcement service of this module and get
  the message.

  
- Put time ellapsed since post instead of date of post, (3 min. 6 hours 3 days ago)
  make this configurabel: User can say after N days passed the date should show,
  before that the ellapsed time
  
- Admin: hide a posting

- Admin: delete a user

- Admin: add a new module manually

- Script that populates databse should not lock the whole database for a long time
  Maybe it should fetch all the data to memory and work there.

- replace the e-mail address checking by  if ($q->param('email') !~ $Email::Address::addr_spec) {

- Enable people to edit their posts 
   - Shall we track changes ? 
   - Shall we display the orinal date and the last update date ?
   - Shall we display the post on its new date (order the display result by date ?)

- Somehow let a module author (or anyone ?) subscribe/unsubscribe to all of her 
  current and future(!) modules.
    1) Enable listing modules based on module author
	2) Enable subscribing to several modules at the same time
	this is not good as this does not cover the "future" thing and people will
	forget to subscribe to the new module when they release one.
	
	So especially the module authors would like to have a button that sais
	subscribe too all the modules of XYZ

- Let people select a group of distros (e.g. all the distros by author SZABGAB)
  and show them on the /mypan interface (or just subscribe to all of them)

- Improve the markup language

- Enable module authors (or some other volunteer) to configure some aspects of the 
  section of their own module

- Posting a message under more than one distribution

- Create larger discussion groups (e.g. Web development and All)

- Get a nice logo and favicon.ico

- xml version of the search results

- Admin: disable posting to a distibution, 

- Admin: hide a distribution and all its postings

- Admin: disable user, change username ?

- Statistics on posts, views etc.

- Other (human) languages (?)

- Enable sending direct mail to a poster (?) (without disclosing e-mail address)

- Better integration with search.cpan.org, cpanratings.perl.org
  Fetch data from  cpanratings and display
  Provide statistics on number of comments per distro to be displayed on search.cpan

- Admin: hide a message (or a whole thread) (database already has field)

- Admin: freeze a distro: (cannot add new message but still can see the earlier messages)

- Admin: (or even the author ?) should be able to move a message from one module to 
          another module or group.
 
- Replace the /post/number link by /post/TITLE_OF_POST ???

- make the page size (for paging) user configurable


- Allow users to subscribe for announcement service:
  A script that will send an announcement on the new version of every module to
  those who asked for this information.

- JavaScript that lets users to set all the modules in /mypan to the same value
  (either All message or thread starter or Followup or nothing)



PROBLEM:
  Currently when a new browse visits the site we immediately give a cookie and
  instert an entry in the sessions table.
  After running for about 10 days we have about 32.000 entries in the sessions table.
  It is not likely that so many people have visited the site.
  I think the crawlers of Google and co. never return the cookie that I give them and
  thus every hit they generate will create a new cookie and a new entry in the sessions
  table. Besides, I never clean up the sessions table.

  So let's see what can we do
  1) Add an index to that table to speed up the access time (this I should do in any case)
  2) If I recognize a crawler (e.g. googlebot) don't give a session ID to it.
  3) Run cleanup routine that will delete old sessions:
     As right now the session time is only kept within the a_session field this will be a slow
	 process but should be done anyway
  4) Add a field to the session table where I indicate the last access time


- A way to monitor all current and future modules associated with a certain PAUSE ID.
 (both RSS and e-mail)
 
- check out the remote authentication module of  David Nicol: AIS::Client
  and its server.
